This repository contains [Concourse][] pipelines and related [Terraform][]
and [BOSH][] manifests that allow provisioning of a VPC with an instance of
Bosh and an instance of Concourse. It provides a generic starting point for
any kind of deployment environment.

[Concourse]: http://concourse-ci.org/
[Terraform]: https://terraform.io/
[BOSH]: https://bosh.io/

## Concourse Lite

This runs outside an environment and is responsible for creating and
destroying a VPC containing Bosh and Concourse.
You don't need to keep this running once Concourse is deployed,
and you can create it again when Concourse needs to be modified
or destroyed.

### Prerequisites

In order to use this repository you will need:

* Predefined [IAM instance profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) that will be assigned to Concourse-lite, BOSH and Concourse. See below for details.

* [AWS Command Line tool (`awscli`)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). You can
install it using [any of the official methods](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
or by using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* a recent version of [Vagrant installed][]. The exact version
requirements are listed in the [`Vagrantfile`](vagrant/Vagrantfile).

* a recent version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

* the `bsdtar` command (you may have it already), the ubuntu package is `libarchive-tools`
[Vagrant installed]: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Install the AWS plugin for Vagrant:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
```

* provide AWS access keys:

This is handled by the GDS CLI, for example:
```sh
gds aws paas-dev-admin -- make dev magic
```
But do set your region:
```sh
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
```


The access keys are only required to spin up *Concourse Lite*. From
that point on they won't be required (except by manual actions) as all the
pipelines will use [instance profiles][] to make calls to AWS. The policies for
these are defined in the repo [aws-account-wide-terraform][]
(not public because it also contains state files).

[instance profiles]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html
[aws-account-wide-terraform]: https://github.com/alphagov/paas-aws-account-wide-terraform

* Declare your environment name using the variable DEPLOY_ENV (max length 8).

```
$ export DEPLOY_ENV=environment-name
```

It is important that you do not use the same `DEPLOY_ENV` for both build and deployer concourse environments, this is to avoid conflicts in resource allocation.

* Choose whether to enable GitHub access and if so, set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

By default, the developers on the team can use GitHub to log in to your dev environment. To make this work you need to
set up a GitHub OAuth application, as [described in the team manual](https://team-manual.cloud.service.gov.uk/guides/Github_oAuth_in-Dev/)

```
$ export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=some-github-client-id
$ export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=some-github-client-secret
```

If you'd prefer not to enable GitHub single-sign-on then you can disable it with:

```
$ export ENABLE_GITHUB=false
```

### Deploy

Create Concourse Lite with `make`. There are Make targets to select the target AWS account, and to select the profiles to apply.

You can create two different things: a deployer concourse or a build concourse.

To start deploying a new Cloud Foundry environment:

```
make dev deployer-concourse bootstrap
```


The above command will deploy a Deployer Concourse which is used for deploying a PaaS.

It is possible to deploy a Build Concourse instead. A Build Concourse is responsible for building and versioning releases, as well as deploying manuals, documentation, product pages, and more.

To start deploying a new build environment:

```
make dev build-concourse bootstrap
```

`make help` will show all available options.

To deploy a concourse with custom profiles, it's necessary to set corresponding ENV vars. eg:
```
BOSH_INSTANCE_PROFILE=bosh-director-foo CONCOURSE_INSTANCE_PROFILE=concourse-foo make dev bootstrap
```

NB: This will [auto-delete overnight](#overnight-deletion-of-environments)
by default.

An SSH tunnel is created so that you can access it securely. The deploy
script can be re-run to update the pipelines or set up the tunnel again.

When complete it will output a URL and BasicAuth credentials that you can
use to login.

### Destroy

Run the following script:

```
make dev bootstrap-destroy
```

## Environment Deployment

### Prerequisites

You will need a working [Concourse Lite](#concourse-lite).

You will need to either configure a [Github oauth application](https://team-manual.cloud.service.gov.uk/guides/Github_oAuth_in-Dev/) or pass `ENABLE_GITHUB=false` when uploading pipelines from this repo

### Deploy

Run the `create-bosh-concourse` pipeline from your *Concourse Lite*. The pipeline will upload itself to the Concourse it has created, which means future runs of the pipeline can be done from there. In theory, we should only need the *Concourse Lite* for the initial bootstrapping.

If the initial run of the pipeline fails, it is likely because you need to upload secrets, execute the following:

```
make dev \
	upload-cyber-secrets \
	upload-cyber-tfvars \
	upload-paas-trusted-people \
	upload-google-oauth \
```

Then trigger the pipeline run again. When triggering the pipeline
from the concourse UI, take care to use the "trigger job" button and
not the "re-run with same inputs button", due to the way terraform
state is managed in this pipeline, re-using old inputs can cause
problems.

When complete, you can access the new Concourse from your browser. The URL
and credentials can be found from:

```
make dev <profile>-concourse showenv
```

Login credentials can be shown by `make <env> showenv`.

### Destroy

Run the `destroy-bosh-concourse` pipeline from your *Concourse Lite*.


# Additional notes

## Sharing your Bootstrap Concourse

If you need to share access to your *Bootstrap Concourse* with a colleague
then you will need to reproduce some of the work that Vagrant does.

Add their SSH public key:

```
cd vagrant
echo "ssh-rsa AAAA... user" | \
   vagrant ssh -- tee -a .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Learn the public IP of your *Bootstrap Concourse* run:

```
cd vagrant
vagrant ssh-config
```

They will then need to manually create the SSH tunnel that is normally
handled by `vagrant/deploy.sh`:

```
ssh ubuntu@<bootstrap_concourse_ip> -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 -fN
```

## Concourse Lite credentials

By default, the Concourse Lite ATC password is generated, based on a hash of AWS UserId.
If the `CONCOURSE_WEB_PASSWORD` environment variable is set, this will be used instead.
It's safe to deterministically generate the password since Concourse Lite is only accessible via an ssh tunnel.

You can print the password with `make <env> showenv`

## Concourse credentials

The Concourse ATC password is randomly generated by the secret generator.
Once generated, it is stored in the s3 state bucket.

## Overnight deletion of environments

In order to avoid unnecessary costs in AWS, there is some logic to
stop environments and VMs at night:

 * **Concourse Lite**: The `self-terminate` pipeline
   will be triggered every night to terminate *Concourse Lite*.

To prevent this from happening, you can simply pause the
pipelines or its resources or jobs.

Note that the *Concourse* and *BOSH* VMs will be kept running.

## aws-cli

You might need [aws-cli][] installed on your machine to debug a deployment.
You can install it using [Homebrew][] or a [variety of other methods][]. You
should provide [access keys using environment variables][] instead of
providing them to the interactive configure command.

[aws-cli]: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
[variety of other methods]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
[access keys using environment variables]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment

## SSH to concourse and tunnel

You can ssh to Concourse using the command: `make ssh_concourse`
This will automatically get the right key and log you in as vcap user.

You can open an SSH tunnel to any TCP socket in the VPC with the command:
`make tunnel TUNNEL=<local_port>:<remote_host>:<remote_port>`

Stop the tunnel with: `make stop-tunnel`

## Other useful commands

Type `make` to get the list of all available commands.

## Known caveats

### Fly version

Current mechanism of updating fly binary only checks if the date of your local
binary is older than one on the server. If you have been using previous fly
version recently, it won't get updated. In that case, delete the binary in /bin
directory and most recent one will be downloaded next time you run the scripts.

### SSH tunnel

The startup of docker compose is a bit non-deterministic. It needs to download
containers and start them. By default, we give it 180s timeout to do that. Most
of the times this will be long enough for concourse to start. But sometimes it
can happen that this is not long enough. In that case, re-run your makefile
action again. The scripts will attempt to connect to concourse again and if
succeeded, will continue with the script and upload the pipelines to concourse.
