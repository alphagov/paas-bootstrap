# BOSH runtime config is configuration which is applied to:
# - all VMs
# - in all deployments
# - except the bosh director vm
#
# Changing the runtime config will roll every VM in a bosh deployment during
# the next 'bosh deploy'
#
# You can only apply addons and releases within the runtime config
